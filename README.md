# Salvation-The-Game
Game remodeling the cult ideology found in the Korean Drama, Save Me.

Save Me: Cult Simulation is an interactive narrative game inspired by the psychological horror and ideological control depicted in the Korean drama Save Me. This project models the emotional, social, and psychological mechanisms that sustain cult systems: obedience, repetition, emotional exhaustion, and the illusion of salvation through submission.

<em>The system favors submission. Inquiry is defiance.</em>

<br>
  Features
<li>Narrative-driven gameplay: Players navigate a looping, oppressive system where every choice feeds — or disrupts — the cult's logic.</li>
<li>Dynamic glitch events: Visual and auditory distortions ("glitch flashes") simulate breakdowns in the cult’s ideological control.</li>
<li>Ambient soundscape: Chanting and ominous background music set an unsettling tone, mirroring the sensory manipulation techniques cults use.</li>
<li>Immersive UI: Candle flickering effects, neon glitches, and a dark minimalist design evoke an atmosphere of isolation and control.</li>
<li>Replayable structure: Players can attempt to break the system — but true escape may not be possible.</li>
<br>
  How It Works
<li>The game begins with the player waking up in a dark sanctuary.</li>
<li>Players respond to prompts, choosing how to interact with the system: submit, question, resist.</li>
<li>Choices affect how the cult system "judges" them — but many paths lead back to obedience, illustrating the closed-loop logic of totalist organizations.</li>
<li>Moments of resistance trigger "fatal errors" and glitch overlays, but the system attempts to reset and regain control.</li>
<li>The only true escape? Recognizing the loop for what it is.</li>

  Inspirations
<li>Save Me (Korean Drama, 2017): Psychological depiction of cult manipulation.</li>
